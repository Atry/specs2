Maintenance version.

## Improvements

 * updated Scalaz versions
 * Add documentation surrounding junit xml output (thanks to @jedesah)
 * fix typo of `haveValues` in Map Matcher (thanks to @taisukeoe)
 * added a section on how to display data even for a successful example
 * renamed some package protected variables in mutable specs to avoid clashes with client code (Scalatra in particular)
